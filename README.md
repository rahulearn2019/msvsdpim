Align - Analog Layout Intelligently generated from netlists
About :
ALIGN is an open source automatic layout generator for analog circuits jointly developed under the DARPA IDEA program by the University of Minnesota, Texas A&M University, and Intel Corporation.

The goal of ALIGN (Analog Layout, Intelligently Generated from Netlists) is to automatically translate an unannotated (or partially annotated) SPICE netlist of an analog circuit to a GDSII layout. The repository also releases a set of analog circuit designs.

The ALIGN flow includes the following steps:

Circuit annotation creates a multilevel hierarchical representation of the input netlist. This representation is used to implement the circuit layout in using a hierarchical manner. Design rule abstraction creates a compact JSON-format represetation of the design rules in a PDK. This repository provides a mock PDK based on a FinFET technology (where the parameters are based on published data). These design rules are used to guide the layout and ensure DRC-correctness. Primitive cell generation works with primitives, i.e., blocks at the lowest level of design hierarchy, and generates their layouts. Primitives typically contain a small number of transistor structures (each of which may be implemented using multiple fins and/or fingers). A parameterized instance of a primitive is automatically translated to a GDSII layout in this step. Placement and routing performs block assembly of the hierarchical blocks in the netlist and routes connections between these blocks, while obeying a set of analog layout constraints. At the end of this step, the translation of the input SPICE netlist to a GDSII layout is complete.

### Installing Align:
