In out floorplan.tcl script we can see there are two ways to initialize floorplan
1. Using utilization factor
2. Using die_area + core_area

It can be seen in config.mk, our flow uses the 2nd method to create floorplan

All other designs have used a smaller voltage domain VD1 using area is specified in config.mk using export VD1_area. Since, we have used other designs like temp_sens or pll as our reference, or config.mk also contains the same commands which creates a smaller voltage domain VD1 with the specified area.
The cells to be placed in that smaller voltage domain is specified by domain_inst.txt ( export domain_inst_list) in confif.mk
The script floorplan.tcl creates the voltage domain



What is  a voltage domain in a design?
As per the dynamic power equation P= a*C*V^2*f 
a= switching probability
C= capacitance being charged/discharged
V= supply voltage
f= clock frequency

as supply voltage is sclaed down power reduces to a great extent. Hence, sub-systems that do not require higher speed of operation, can be operated at lower voltages, saving dynamic power.
The design can have multiple voltages as per the performance requirement.
*********IMPORTANT************
sub-systems that operate at different voltages have separate power domains, each having separate supply and nets. This requires the use of level-shifters to pass a voltage signal from one domain
to another

*******
To remove the voltage domain

--remove export_domain_inst_list from config.mk
-- remove export VD_1 area from config.mk
--remove  create_voltage domain VD_1 from floorplan.tcl in the section - initialize floorplan using die_area core_area
