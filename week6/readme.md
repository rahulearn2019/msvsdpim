# RTL2GDS of the Analog design using openROAD( invoked by openFASOC)

With the necessary input files - gds of analog blocks and their dummy verilog we can proceed with the openFASOC flow to generate the complete analog block GDS.    
A directory - avsd4bituc, is created in the generators directory of openfasoc

The necessary sub-directories for avsd4bituc are created.

The dummy verilog files are placed in the src directory

### contents of the test.json file
Include the frequency parameter in test.json file, and min and max frequency values are given according to the min max frequency vlaues defined in parameters.py script by default. In my case in parameters.py, by default min_freq is 5Mhz and max frequency is 12 Mhz. I went with the same frequencies for the design.

These values can be edited in parameters.py file in tools folder

The same frequency values are fed in modelfile.csv file present in tools directory.

### modifications in toplevel makefile - edit the commands that will be used for different purposes - verilog generation, rtl2gds etc.

avsd4bituc-gen.py file is created and modifed

<details>
<summary>avsd4bituc-gen.py script</summary>
<br>

```python

```

</details>


### The LEF and GDS of the auxilliary cells are placed in avsd4bituc/blocks/sky130hd - lef and gds folders respectively
To create LEF and GDS
- Import <design_name>.python.gds generated by Klayout
- Manually place the labels at repective locations. The make number of the port is the serial number of ports present in pre-layout spice netlist.
label VDD
port make 1
- After placing the labels - ``` port makeall```
- Rename the cellname as the same you want to use in your OpenFASOC flow - ```cellname rename ADC_FLASH_0 onebitADC```
- Write GDS - ```gds write onebitADC.gds```
- write LEF - ```lef writeall```

### The config.mk file in design directory is modified -
1. DESIGN_NICKNAME is changed
2. DESIGN_NAME is changed
3. verilog file top-module name is changed
4. Additional GDS and LEF file names are changed
5. Custom connections are removed if any
6. Domain Instances are removed if any(since we do not need any additional voltage domain. Domain instances LIST will use a domain_instances.txt which should contain cells to be placed in that domain.
7. VD1 area is removed  represents the area that needs to be alloted to a smaller voltage domain)

### Concept of a voltage domain


Now a shell is opened in the avsd4bituc directory in generators and to generate verilog the corresponding code defined in top level makefile is used. In my case - "make sky130hd_auc_verilog"

To run the remaining steps - synthesis, placement, routing and finishing - we cd into flow directory and open a shell, then the following commands are used one by one -

```make synth```

```make floorplan```
![Screenshot from 2023-03-31 22-04-34](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50217106/229181225-b33eca80-c1dc-4b84-89ca-112a1d78d7b5.png)

```make gui_floorplan```

```make place```

``` make gui_place```
Since the flow was placement of macros only, and there are no standard cells, floorplan and placement gui are same. It has been observed that floorplan stage uses the LEF while placement stage uses GDS. When origin co-ordinates in LEF and GDS are not matching, it leeds to displacement of cells in placement or floorplan stage.

```make route```


```make gui_route```

```make finish```

The flow writes files genarated at individual steps in /avsd4bit-uc/flow/results
